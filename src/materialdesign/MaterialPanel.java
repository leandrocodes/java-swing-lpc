/**
 * A JPanel customized for Material components. What makes these panels special
 * is the possibility of assigning them an elevation level. Elevation can help
 * distinguishing elements inside a Material-based GUI, and any changes done to
 * them result in nicely animated transitions, helping to achieve that Material
 * flow.
 *
 * However, there is a catch: shadows are kinda expensive to compute, as Java2D
 * relies on the CPU for anything other than images, so having a lot of elements
 * with a given elevation (and thus, a shadow) can reduce performance when these
 * elevations change due to the triggered animations.
 *
 * Letting the components suggest a prefered size based on their contents is
 * still under development, so it is not advised to use your favorite
 * {@link LayoutManager} inside a {@code MaterialPanel} unless you set the
 * prefered, minimum and maximum size of each component by yourself. Currently,
 * the prefereable approach to follow is overriding {@link #doLayout()} and
 * taking care of any arrangements by yourself.
